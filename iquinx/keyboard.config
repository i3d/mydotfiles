1. have to use layer.
2. select a layer first, probably from layer 1.
3. setup h,j,k,l to left, down, up, right
4. setup the same layer of cap_locks to Advanced Keys 'Esc ~', not just Esc
5. back to layer 0, setup the cap_locks to osl(x) where x is the layer chosen.

unforunately the above doesn't work really well.

so far, we have to compromise.

layer 1. 

esc and ~ 

cap_locks : mod(3)

in layer 3 : change to arrows
in layer 3: change esc to (~and`)
